\section{Data Preprocessing}
The first clinical-operational choice for \textit{Data Preprocessing} was to work only on baseline visits (VISCODE == "bl"), because the goal is to predict the diagnosis based on the information collected at the first visit; this filter reduced the dataset from 16,421 to 2,419 rows. 

I discover that the acronym \textbf{SMC} stands for "\textit{Subjective Memory Concern}", and refers to \textit{cognitively normal} (CN) subjects who perceive memory difficulties. Introduced in ADNI2 to increase variability in the CN and MCI groups, this category does not correspond to an objective deficit. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to train machine learning models to predict a phenomenon based solely on the patient's subjective perception from objective data. Therefore, observations with \linebreak DX\_bl = "SMC" were realigned using the DX variable, but ultimately all were classified as CN.
